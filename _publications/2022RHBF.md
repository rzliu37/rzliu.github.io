The ridged-hammer bipolar flaking (RHBF) was characterized in the 1970s but how it was practiced have long remained a controversial topic. The discovery of Guanzhou site in Songzi County of Hubei Province offers an excellent opportunity to rethink and re-evaluate the issue. Combining archaeological materials and experimental data, we show how this particular technology was formed and put into practice and suggest that it can be used by both male and female in convenient ways. We argue on the basis of archaeological contexts and ethnographic information that the RHBF technique characterized the Upper and Middle Yangtze valley in the Paleolithic-Neolithic transition. It was adopted as one of the major adaptive strategies to intensify the utilization of resources at the time
