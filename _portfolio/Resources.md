Handbooks for non-English Students  
======
- Introduction: When I first came to the United States, nothing was more problematic than the various abbreviations. When my colleagues talked about them, I had absolutely no background information and only knew what they meant when I went searching for them myself afterwards. Also, there were terms that I could not relate to my own cultural background, which made it difficult for me to understand. After three years of adapting to the English environment, I have now finally built my own contextualization manual, and I plan to spend some time summarizing it and then write this manual in the hope that you won't have to go through the same headache phase I did before.
