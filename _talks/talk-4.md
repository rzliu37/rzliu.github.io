I was the presenter. My presented topic is "Expanding Horizons: Reimagining Archaeology in the Modern Material Culture Era". 

This research is based on my fieldwork in modern matrilineal societies, and as a researcher with a background in archaeology, I discuss the importance of anthropological and ethnographic research in China to inform archaeologists' exploration of a wider range of topics, and to encourage Chinese archaeology to join in with wider topics of human evolution, modernity, and human behavioral ecology.
